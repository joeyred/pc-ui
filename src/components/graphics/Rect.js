  //      SVG is always square.
  //
  //      I've concluded that this should be handled by the container, and not the SVG.
  //      Use the SquareContainer component instead of adding the functionality here.
  //
  //      Yes it's one more <div> layer, but the seperation of functionality in display is
  //      far more defined in that respect. At least that's what I hope.
